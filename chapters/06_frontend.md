## ðŸ›¹ Interacting with Wallets 

<br>

* A wallet is a software or hardware that stores a secret key to keep it secure and handle secure transaction signing.

* Solana's [@solana/wallet-adapter-base and @solana/wallet-adapter-react.-Adapter](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) are libraries used to simplify the process of supporting wallet browser extensions.

* `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` allows us to persist and access wallet connection states through hooks and context providers:
    - `useWallet`
    - `WalletProvider`
    - `useConnection`
    - `ConnectionProvider`

* Any use of `useWallet` and `useConnection` should be wrapped in `WalletProvider` and `ConnectionProvider`.

* `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` allows the creation of custom components for, such as:
    - `WalletModalProvider`
    - `WalletMultiButton`
    - `WalletConnectButton`
    - `WalletModal`
    - `WalletModalButton`
    - `WalletDisconnectButton`
    - `WalletIcon`

## ðŸ›¹ Serializing Data and PDA

<br>

### Instruction Serialization

<br>

* Instruction data must be serialized into a byte buffer to send to clients. 

* Every transaction contains:
    - an array with every account it intends to read or write
    - one or more instructions
    - a recent blockhash
    - one or more signatures

* Every instruction contains:
    - the program ID (public key) of the intended program
    - an array listing every account that will be read from or written to during execution
    - a byte buffer of instruction data

<br>

### Libraries

* [@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) simplifies this process, so developers can focus on adding instructions and signatures. 
    - The library builds the array of accounts based on that information and handles the logic for including a recent blockhash.


* To facilitate this process of serialization, we can use [Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashin (Borsh)](https://borsh.io/) and the library [@coral-xyz/borsh](https://github.com/coral-xyz).
    - Borsh can be used in security-critical projects as it prioritizes consistency, safety, speed; and comes with a strict specification.

<br>

### PDA

<br>

* Programs store data in PDAs (Program Derived Address), which can be thought as a key value store, where the address is the key, and the data inside the account is the value.
    - Like records in a database, with the address being the primary key used to look up the values inside.

* PDAs do not have a corresponding secret key. 
    - To store and locate data, we derive a PDA using the `findProgramAddress(seeds, programid)` method.

* The accounts belonging to a program can be retrieved with `getProgramAccounts(programId)`.
    - Account data needs to be deserialized using the same layout used to store it in the first place.
    - Accounts created by a program can be fetched with `connection.getProgramAccounts(programId)`.



<br>

## ðŸ›¹ RPC Pagination 

<br>

* RPC calls can be used to paginate, order and filter deserialized account data, through some configuration options for the `getProgramAccounts`:
    1. You can fetch a large number of accounts without their data by filtering them to return just an array of public keys.
    2. Once you have a filtered list of public keys, you can order them and fetch the account data they belong to.

* `dataSlice` lets you provide two things:
    - `offset`,  the offset from the beginning of the data buffer to start the slice
    - `length`, the number of bytes to return, starting from the provided offset

<br>

```javascript
const accountsWithoutData = await connection.getProgramAccounts(
  programId,
  {
    dataSlice: { offset: 0, length: 0 }
  }
)

const accountKeys = accountsWithoutData.map(account => account.pubkey)
```

<br>

* `filters` let you match specific criteria, which can have objects matching the following:
    - `memcmp`, compares a provided series of bytes with program account data at a particular offset. Fields:
        - `offset`, the number to offset into program account data before comparing data
        - `bytes`, a base-58 encoded string representing the data to match; limited to less than 129 bytes
        - `dataSize`, compares the program account data length with the provided data size
